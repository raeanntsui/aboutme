### Hello, I am Raeann Tsui. Welcome to my profile!

I made the transition from medicine to software development. I decided to pursue a career in this field because it offers not only creativity in problem solving but also flexibility since not every problem has only 1 solution.

During my time at App Academy, I learned a new set of skills in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, and explored the implementation of AWS in my personal project. Noteworthy among my achievements is the development of a rental booking site using Express and React. Additionally, I collaborated alongside fellow developers to create a Yelp clone, utilizing Python and React, within 1 week.
